# Repository Work

## üì• How to Upload Your Exercises

To keep an organized structure and avoid conflicts, we kindly ask you to follow the next process:

1. **Create a Branch:** Before starting to work on your exercises, create a branch with your username or some unique identifier.
    - Example: `git checkout -b username-exercises`

2. **Work on Your Branch:** Do all the proposed exercises and save your changes in this branch. You can see your current branch with `git branch`.

3. **Commit and Push:** Once you've finished, commit your changes and push them to your branch.
    - Example:
      ```
      git add .  or  git add [files to upload]
      git commit -m "CLI chapter exercises completed"
      git push origin username-exercises
      ```

4. **Request Review:** If you want others to review your exercises or seek feedback, create a "Pull Request" from your branch to the main branch (usually `main` or `master`). This will notify the rest of the participants and they can view and comment on your work.

Remember to keep your branch updated with the main branch to always have the latest version of the course material.

# Directory Structure

To keep the repository organized, we kindly ask you to follow the next directory structure when uploading your exercises:

- A main directory named after the chapter (e.g., `Chapter01-CLI`).
  - Inside this, a subdirectory for each exercise (e.g., `Exercise01`, `Exercise02`, ...).
    - Within each subdirectory, place the files related to the exercise and a `readme.md` with any relevant explanation or comment.

This will help us maintain order and will make the review and feedback process easier.

## üìñ Chapter 1: Introduction to the CLI (Command-Line Interface)
In the age of colorful, button-filled, animated graphical interfaces, it might seem like the Command-Line Interface, or CLI, is a relic of the past. But nothing could be further from the truth. Despite its outward simplicity, the CLI remains a potent and essential tool in any developer's toolkit.

The CLI offers us direct, unrestricted access to the very heart of our system, allowing us to perform intricate tasks with a string of commands or even automate these tasks. By learning to use the CLI, you won‚Äôt only gain a valuable skill but will also get a deeper understanding of how computers and operating systems function.

In this chapter, we'll delve into the world of the CLI, using the `bash` shell, one of the most popular and widely-used command-line interfaces in the Linux world. While it may seem daunting at first, with practice and patience, you'll soon feel comfortable and confident using `bash`.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Exercises:

### [Exercise 1](https://github.com/pentarix1996/learn_development_bases/tree/main/Chapter%201/Exercise%201)
### [Exercise 2](https://github.com/pentarix1996/learn_development_bases/tree/main/Chapter%201/Exercise%202)

## üìå Appendices:

### A. Prerequisites:

1. **Basic Computer Literacy:** Participants are expected to have a basic understanding of how to operate a computer, launch applications, and browse the web.

2. **Operating System:** The examples and exercises in this chapter will be based on Linux‚Äôs `bash` shell. If you are using Windows or Mac, don't worry, we'll guide you through the setup process.
    - **For Windows users:** We recommend installing a virtual machine running Ubuntu. You can follow [this tutorial](https://personales.unican.es/corcuerp/Linux/Install_Ubuntu_On_Windows_10_Using_VirtualBox.html) for a step-by-step guide. Another option is using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). However, for this course, we'll focus on the virtual machine to ensure a uniform experience for all users.
    
    - **For Mac users:** While macOS comes with its own terminal and shell (which is akin to `bash`), we recommend following the same steps as Windows users to ensure uniformity in learning. However, if you choose to use the Mac terminal, most commands should work similarly.

### B. Additional Recommendations:

1. **Regular Practice:** As with any new skill, practice makes perfect. We encourage you to regularly practice the commands and exercises presented to you.

2. **Take Notes:** Even though you'll have access to all the materials and commands in this Git repository, we advise taking your own notes. Handwriting or typing out commands and their functions will help with retention.
